# JSMongoDB
I have created Tourists and Flights database and connected to them via JavaScript. 
Added CRUD and autofill flights numbers.

TO DO:
NORMALIZATION- seriously, this database should be normalized. The flights column in Tourists table shall not be a list, better option is to make a new table with only ONE flight ID connected with ONE touristID.

PS: I couldnt sent whole program here, so I ve just uploaded most interesting files in here. To see how it works I ve also made a short video.
